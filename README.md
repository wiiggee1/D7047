#### Final project - Evaluating three Pre-trained Transfer Learning models for Pneumonia detection

##### Abstract: 
"Chest X-Rays are a medical imaging method used
to detect pneumonia. The x-ray images have to be evaluated
by a trained radiologist to determine if the patient is infected.
To support the decision, medical computer vision techniques
can be used. In modern computer vision, deep learning is the
most common method. For applications with little training data,
transfer learning can be used to apply a pre-trained model on
different data. In this paper, we compare three different pre-
trained models: GoogleNet, ResNet-50 and DenseNet. These are
used on a dataset containing chest X-Rays of children. During
training, the weights of these networks are fine-tuned to classify
if the images contains pneumonia. We use t-SNE to visualize
the features in different layers and GradCam to visualize on
which image region the network bases its decision on. With
the chosen approach, we are able to reach 93 percent accuracy
for the ResNet-50 and comparable accuracies for the other
networks".
